# { Games : Rest API } üéÆ
## About API üìö
This is an Rest API witch the users can see a Games list, registered in database. However, when the users register themselves, they have free access to some routes, in witch, they can **register a new game**, **delete a existing game** and **update or change information about some game**. This Rest API was made to learn more about the *http* methods and see the *http's* status code.

## Building ‚öô
You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and i recommend that you have installed the [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) on your computer. With your setup completed, you will need to instal [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and create an empty database.

Before register the games, you need to register a user, and log in with this user email. Logging in, get the generated *Token Code*, and user this token to access, the others games Routes, passing the token as a value in authentication ``Bearer Token``.

This is API is running at port ``3333`` ```http://localhost:3333```;
